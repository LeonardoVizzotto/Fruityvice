## Instaling

Run `yarn`

## Development server

Run `yarn dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Build

Run `yarn build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `.next/` directory.

## Running the production build

Run `yarn start` to run the production build.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `yarn cypress:run` to execute the end-to-end tests via a [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

## Considerations:

- This was my first project using Next
- I used this project as an opportunity to learn a little bit of [`styled-components`](https://styled-components.com/) as I've never tried it before
